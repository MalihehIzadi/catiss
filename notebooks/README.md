# Notebooks

Here are the Jupyter notebooks 
for (1) preprocessing the provided train and test datasets, 
(2) fine-tuning the RoBERTa model on issue reports,
and (3) evaluating the model.
Also note that `data_prep_plus_model_training.ipynb` 
contains all processes in one notebook (cleaning, training and evaluation).
